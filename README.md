# Jira Clone

A little project I did at work before the onboarding process was finished and I was moved into a regular team.

### What it can do
- basic CRUD operations (it connects to a real DB running postgreSQL)
- drag and drop between the stauts-columns

### Todo:
- [ ] navigation to a details-page of each Issue
- [ ] search for an issue by ID or by name (incl. autocompletion)
- [ ] dark mode toggle via custom react-hook

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to run

After starting the corresponding SpringBoot-Application type `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
to view it in the browser.
