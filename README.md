# Jira Clone

A little project I did at work before the onboarding process was finished and I was moved into a regular team.

### What it can do
- drag and drop between the status-columns will update the issue status
- create popup accessible from the sidenav
- details page for each issue (for editing an issue)
- confirmation popup on delete
- search for an issue by ID or by name (incl. autocompletion)
- dark mode toggle via custom react-hook

### Todo:
- [ ] add functional search bar to the blue menu bar
- [ ] make the site more responsive for smaller screens (no mobile view planned)
- [ ] maybe: implement a backlog page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to run

After starting the corresponding SpringBoot-Application type `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
to view it in the browser.
